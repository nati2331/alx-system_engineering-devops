Postmortem: Database Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration: April 25, 2024, 10:00 PM - April 26, 2024, 06:00 AM (PST)
Impact: The database service experienced a complete outage, rendering the application inaccessible to all users for approximately 8 hours.
Root Cause: A critical hardware failure in the primary database server resulted in data corruption and service disruption.
Timeline:
April 25, 2024, 10:15 PM (PST): Issue detected when automated monitoring systems reported database connectivity failures.
April 25, 2024, 10:30 PM (PST): Engineers initiated investigation, suspecting network issues due to recent infrastructure upgrades.
April 25, 2024, 11:00 PM (PST): Misleadingly focused on network configurations and firewall settings.
April 26, 2024, 01:00 AM (PST): Escalated incident to database administration team for deeper analysis.
April 26, 2024, 02:30 AM (PST): Root cause identified as hardware failure in the primary database server.
April 26, 2024, 04:00 AM (PST): Implemented failover to secondary database server to restore service.
April 26, 2024, 06:00 AM (PST): Service fully restored after repairing the primary database server.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: A critical hardware component failure (RAID controller) in the primary database server caused data corruption and service outage.
Resolution: Service was restored by failing over to the secondary database server while the primary server was repaired and data integrity verified.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement redundant RAID controllers and regular hardware health checks to detect potential failures proactively.
Enhance monitoring to include hardware health metrics and automatic failover mechanisms.
Develop comprehensive disaster recovery procedures to minimize downtime in the event of hardware failures.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of hardware configurations and identify potential single points of failure.
Schedule routine maintenance to replace aging hardware components before they reach end-of-life.
Update incident response protocols to include rapid failover procedures for critical services like the database.
This incident underscores the importance of robust hardware redundancy and proactive maintenance in ensuring the reliability and availability of our database infrastructure. By implementing the recommended improvements and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to minimize the impact of similar hardware failures in the future and maintain uninterrupted service for our users.
